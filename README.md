# Dev Test 3

## Scenario.
You have taken up maintenance on an application created by another developer.  
The application allows searching for a player by name to view their ranking.  
Testers have found several bugs.

### Bugs.
* Searching by name does not work correctly.
  * Seaching for "john doe" or "jake rob" does not seem to work.
* When no player is found, a 500 error occurs.
* When no player is entered and submit is pressed, a 500 error occurs.

## Your Task.
In your pull request
* Describe in detail the reason that the search was not always working.
* Fix all of the bugs.  For the 500 errors listed above, have it show an appropriate message.
